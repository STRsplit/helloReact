Default values:
- set default props using a getDefaultProps function and set the default props that will be entered if no additional props are passed in.

- props get passed in, state is internally maintained by the component

Nesting Components:
- create the components above the main components
- reference the components with their name inside of <Example/>


Two types of components:
- presentational component - renders something to the browser.
- container components - used to create the structure where presentational components are rendered.


Parent function -
use handle’EVENT’ then for child name it on'EVENT’

Updating props value not allowed in React - can only update the state of the prop in the component.
